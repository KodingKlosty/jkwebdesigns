Marketing, SEO, and Analytics

Marketing Plan

This section will consist of online and offline marketing campaigns. Each will be broken down and discussed why they are effective ways to market to local and regional areas. 

Offline:

A great way to get an offline marketing campaign started would be a speaking event. (Biz) This would allow you to not only get your name out there but give back to the community too. If you did a small speaking engagement at a local community college to drum up interest in web design and development, you could use that to market your business. (Biz)

Something else that would go along with that is offering to mentorship/internship to an up and coming web developer. This would serve another dual purpose, not only do you give back, but that student is now a walking/talking billboard for your business. They will get asked by family and friends about their experiences with you and your business. This just takes a little bit of your time and could net you a lot of business. 

Networking also goes with offline marketing. Going to various local events is a great way to drum up interest in any business. There are plenty of community events that take place in an area that would allow you to peak interest in your business and show your talents off. (Biz)

Business cards are a must for any of the above marketing scenarios. You’ll want to be able to give people a walking reminder of who you are and what you offer. This is one of the cheapest ways that you can market, especially when you’re freelancing. Being able to post your information on public bulletin boards for a few pennies is a huge plus. 

Online: 

Social Media is probably the most obvious ways to market online. Having a Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and/or blogging are all great ways to market your brand with social media. 
This allows you to reach multiple groups of people all over the world or just in your local area. One other up and coming platform is Tik Tok. With this platform a web developer could do a time lapse of designing a logo for website. (forbes)

Another more covert way to target someone after they visit your site is by retargeting. Once someone visits and leaves your site a cookie is left on their computer and when they visit other sites an ad will popup.  This increases your exposure and gets them talking and more importantly revisiting your site to buy the solution you offer. 

Freelance sites like Upwork or Fivver are other ways to get your presents built online, especially when freelancing. Doing a few jobs on one of these sites while working with local business can get you views to your portfolio. 


Search Engine Optimization Plan:

In order get started off on the right foot I need to fine my niche and who my competitors are, if I’m able to compete with them and if I’m able to outrank them.  This will help me establish how to improve my portfolio. I also need to find out if I am already hitting on any keywords. I also want to build a list of keywords that will help me get hits on my portfolio. Things I also want to look out for are how long it takes my portfolio to load.

Some keyword and phrases I plan to use are:
web designer
website builder
custom website
Lenoir website designer
Hickory web designer
website writer 
website coder
web developer

I asked several of my family members to help give me some words they would use to looking for someone to build a website. Part of the list above is what they came up with. I felt it would be a good idea to ask those around me because they aren’t as technically savvy as I am. My thinking behind this was if they came up with the words and phrases then other have probably thought of them as well. 

Something else I have read that will help with SEO is to do an audit of my portfolio. Things like removing content that is not relative, improving content, and re-publishing content can all help my cause can optimize my portfolio. Once my portfolio is up and running, I will have to periodically audit my portfolio. I want to show that I am keeping my portfolio up to date and creating new content, even if I am just doing it to stay relevant. 

Next, I need to promote my brand. This happens online and offline and can help drive my traffic. Search engines can identify brand and help translate those into a stronger authority. This ties directly in with Marketing because using Facebook, Instagram, and other social media outlets can help drive people to my portfolio. I have found that in order to better promote my brand I should probably change the name of my web design business. While this does go along with my marketing plan, I felt it is better implemented in my SEO plan. 

The final on going part of this plan is to continue to learn and improve my SEO plan. Having a solid working SEO plan is something that any web designer knows you have to have. It’s something that is organic and always changes. New strategies are being tested and built every day and this plan has to evolve too. (RS)

Analytics Plan:

I plan to start with Google Analytics because of all the free tools they do offer. Using Google Analytics will at a least give a foot hold on what is going on with my portfolio and how I can improve it. I have found some other tools that I would like to try as I could afford them. 

Another I would like to really take a hard looking to is Clicktale. I really like the session replay works and showing me how my visitors are using my site and what they are looking at. Another feature that I really like is the heatmap feature that shows where my visitors are clicking. I also like the integration with Adobe and Google to help show true data. The only thing that concerns me about this option is that it seems to be geared toward large companies rather than individuals. (UXM)

Being a programmer, I really love open-source projects. Many times, they have a community that is willing to help and improve on a project. One that has stuck out to me recently is Open Web Analytics. I was able to see a demo and starting out without any income I think this might be my best option. Open Web has a lot of the same data many of the other analytics tools have and navigation is easy. (OWA)

With all the choices that we have to choose from sometimes it just comes down to cost. As I start out on my web development freelance adventure, I start with nothing but a computer and my mind. With little or no starting capital having free and open source options is very important to me. I think in my early days with my portfolio, I will use Open Web and Google Analytics because of the free options they do have. I want to start will little to no money out of pocket and what I do spend money on needs to have a high rate of return.  

My goals small but I would like to get 150 to 300 views in my first year of operation and 3 to 4 website builds. I know that the goals are small, but we all have to start somewhere. I can measure my views by both Open Web and Google Analytics, find out what people are hitting on and tweak my keywords, so I show higher on the web searches in my area. The website builds will be easy because I’ll be able to show them on my portfolio.
