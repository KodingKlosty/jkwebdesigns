Portfolio 7 Project Proposal
By: James Klostermeyer

Proposal Objectives:

I am seeking approval for my Portfolio 7 Plan. This plan will outline what I want to accomplish this month in Portfolio 7. The reason I want to complete this project in the manner outlined below is because it will challenge me and assist in establishing a solid foundation for which I am launching a career in web design and development.

Research Conducted:

Over the last week, I have taken much time to research my chosen target audience. I decided many months ago to do freelance work and primarily target non-franchised, mom-and-pop stores and small businesses that need to have a website update or website built all together. In order to target these type business and individuals I will need to have something they are able to reference to see what I have worked on in the past. Having a portfolio of websites I have built that is easily accessible to prospective clients will help get my freelancing career off the ground. 

There are a lot of things to remember when dealing with the general public, and a big one that stands out from my recent research is not to speak web developer lingo to my potential clients. (dianev) I need to speak in terms and ways that my clients would understand. Something else that was mentioned is to narrow the demographic. You cannot cater to everyone, but by catering to a specific group of people, you will drive business and limit competition. (dianev) I need to build a mock ideal client. (fcc) This will allow me to find out what drives their business and make them successful (fcc) I also need to share my story, which I plan on doing. (fcc) This will show my progression from not knowing any code outside html to full blown react apps. One of the biggest things that stuck out to me during my research was, “clients pay for solutions, not services,” and, “Your offered Solutions + Your Target Market + the Value Provided.” (fcc) Both of these really hit home for me. They are a good reminder that I am solving a problem for my clients. Offering my solutions to that problem and executing that solution is what will make me successful. (medium)

Project Plan:

I want a small but effective portfolio that will showcase some of my talents and things I have learned at Full Sail University. Below is a breakdown of each page and what I would like to have on them. 

Landing Page:

Will have a headshot of me on the right side of page, a small blurb about me and some directions on how to view my works and about me. In the center under the logo, there will be an area for the client to login to the web portal. 

Portfolio Page:

Will be setup with a pagination of websites and apps I have worked on and are finished. It will rotate photos of the apps every 4 to 6 seconds. When a potential client clicks on the photo it will take them to that website or web app to allow them to use the app. My capstone project will be displayed here. I will also feature a to-do app and a password generation app. 
Both of these will showcase my front-end abilities and my back-end abilities. 

About Me:

This page will have a few small paragraphs about me and my journey at Full Sail. This is where I plan display some of my early works to my most recent ones.
